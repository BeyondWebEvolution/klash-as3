Welcome to leaf-framework! By Alberto Taiuti.
--------------------------------
	 * leaf-framework is a framework (obviously) coded in AS3 for agile
	 * development of my flash games. Initially developed as the basis
	 * for a coursework of the 1st year CGT course at Abertay Dundee, it has expanded
	 * and has being used in many of my flash games. 
	 * Used also as a blueprint for the JavaScript orange-framework.
